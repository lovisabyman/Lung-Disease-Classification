# Lung-Disease-Classification
Classification of the presence of effusion in X-ray images of the chest using Vision Transformers. This project was done as a part of the course CS 131: Computer Vision: Foundation and Applications at Stanford University by Lovisa Byman.

The dataset used in this project was the ChestX-Det dataset [1]. The network used is largely based on the network suggested in the paper “An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale” [2], and the implementation is based on an example by Khalid Salama [3].
